Assalamu alaykum,

My name is Ismail, in full: Masharipov Ismoiljon. I have accepted this challenge and started working on it. I will do my best.

It was pretty fun. At first, I was confused about which display this was for, but then I did the available one using identical sizing as it is in Figma. Alhamdulillah, I have done it.

Difficulties: I had completely forgotten about positioning in CSS, so I had to revise and use it well. I wanted to make it responsive in this approach.

I wanted to make responsive but there was a question about making it responsive, and the answer was: "No need to make it responsive."

In my third rewriting of the code entirely, I could finally match it with the design in Figma
